# WikiReader

Find wikipedia sites and let them read out to you

## State of the Art:
- finds wikipedia sites and shows full text (not scrollable by now)
- german language
- start reading out the hole text
- stop the text

## TODO:
- other languages
- split wiki-sites in chapters
- select chapters to be read out
- UI improvements
- replace some text passages to be more smooth by reading out (e.g. "* 10.02.1992" with "born on the 10th February in 1992")
